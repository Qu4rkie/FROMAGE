# FROMAGE
Welcome to the FROMAGE code!
If you've made it this far, you've probably either gotten way too involved reading an April Fool's article, or digging around my github! Either way, sounds like you've got some time to lose!
That's good, because its precisely what this code is meant for!
You can run the code with all the "model" cheeses in this repository, or add your own cheeses (or why even stay limited to cheese?). The code is in the Cheddar.ipynb file, it is made for google collab so you could run it there, or if you download the files locally you'll need to update the file paths!
The rest should be pretty self explanatory, youll need a recent version of numpy, scipy and matplotlib and thats about it!
Have fun fitting cheeses to whatever takes your fancy, or just waiting for Godot!
